This is a free, open-source, **undeveloped**, and **incomplete** version of the Muscle Up app, which will be released in the Play Store. It connects via Bluetooth to a Raspberry Pi and utilizes Mediapipe to analyze workouts in real-time through a camera. The data is then returned to the app, where the user can access various statistics, training plans, and challenges. 

**Keep in mind that the code for this application has not been written in compliance with design patterns or guidelines, which I didn't know at the time. The full version, of course, follows all the rules and is well documented.**

The full version, among other features, allows for online competition and integrates the AI model in-app.
