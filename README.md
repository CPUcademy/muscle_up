# Muscle Up (Early Open-Source Version)

**Muscle Up** is a free, open-source, undeveloped, and incomplete early version of the app that will later be released on the Play Store.

The app connects via **Bluetooth** to a **Raspberry Pi** and uses **Mediapipe** to analyze workouts in real time through a camera.  
The processed data is then sent back to the app, where users can access various **statistics**, **training plans**, and **challenges**.

## Important Note

This version was created when I was **still learning Android development**, so the code does **not** follow standard design patterns, architecture guidelines, or best practices.

It is one of the **earliest public versions**, shared primarily to **demonstrate how to connect Mediapipe and Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth**.

The full version of **Muscle Up** (not included here) is:
- Fully rewritten and structured according to design principles  
- Well-documented and stable
